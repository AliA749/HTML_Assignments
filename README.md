Completed:This project is to show my abilities in HTML,CSS, and Javascript. This project contains the following: Main page that will lead the user to the desired page, jeopardy page ,which is a fun game for the user to play to compete for the most points, 
another game which is based on 3 lives if you get the questions in easy mode right you continue just as all of them. But in easy if you get an question wrong you lose 1 life, in medium you lose 2, and if you get one question wrong in hard you lose all 3 lives.
The next page is a research engine based on google but with dropdown box instead of a input box and has stem based results that are limited along with that page it shows another page with images for the user to see based on those stem carriers. Second to last we have 
a medical page where the user is either a first time patient or a well known patient. This will show my intermediate levels of code bu t  i will later put queries and or local storage. The medical page has check up,bmi calculator, water calculator based on weight, medicine pcik up, and emergencies. Lastly the last page is a calculator with some scientific calculator aspects such as, SIN, COS, and TAN, and Squared and Square root. This project will set me up for success and I everday will do little updates to make these webpages more efficent.
